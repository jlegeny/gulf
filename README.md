# Gulf Theme

Gulf theme for popular text editors:

- QtCreator
- XCode

## QtCreator

Initially I have made this theme for QtCreator and still use it after years.
This is why it gets most frequent updates.

### Installation

On macOS and Linux the recommended way of installing the Gulf theme is to clone
this repository and simlink the file `qtcreator/gulf.xml` into
`~/.config/QtProject/qtcreator/styles`. You may need to create this folder
first.

On Windows, copy this file into `%APPDATA%\Roaming\QtProject\qtcreator\styles`.

## XCode
